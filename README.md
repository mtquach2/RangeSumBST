# RangeSumBST

NAME: Michelle Quach

PURPOSE OF LAB: Understanding Binary Search Trees. 

METHOD USED: For the rangeSum method, we first start at the root of the tree. Then, we check to see which values in the tree are between the values L and R by going down each side of the tree starting with the left and then the right (since the left is less than the right). If they are between the values(L and R), then we add them to the sum.
